My name is Yao Ding. I mostly work in the magic realm of web front-end and consider myself an engineer (because my MS degree is Computer Engineer). 

I consider myself an average programmer and a subpar blogger, so I will try my best to keep my thoughts down here.

This site is built with Jekyll.

Additional features:
1. Barba.js for PJAX and smooth transition between pages.
2. Pace.js for page load progress bar.
3. Organizing other static pages in to `_page` folder following [this](http://damonbauer.me/organizing-jekyll-pages/).
