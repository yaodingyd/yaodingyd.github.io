My name is Yao Ding. I mostly work in the magic realm of web front-end and consider myself an engineer (because my MS degree is Computer Engineer). I like to build web app with Angular 1.x, React, and of course, VanillaJS; run test with Karma, written in Jasmine or Mocha; and use module bundler like Webpack, and module loader like RequireJS. I love Object Oriented Programming, enjoy Prototype Inheritance in Javascript, and embrace Functional Programming. BTW, I love Vue.js and really want to see more company using Vue.

I'm also fluent in PHP, Node and Java, familiar with SQL and ORM, and have a bunch of experience with RESTful Services and APIs. I do freelance projects invovling full-stack work, from server(Apache), database(MySql) to backend and frontend.

I consider myself an average programmer and a subpar blogger, so I will try my best to keep my thoughts down here.

This site is built with Jekyll.
