My name is Yao Ding. I mostly do front-end stuff, and a little bit back-end stuff. My Master's and Bachelor's degrees
are both Engineering, so I prefer meself as a engineer.

I consider myself an average programmer and a subpar blogger, so I will try my best to keep my thoughts down here.

This site is built with Jekyll.
